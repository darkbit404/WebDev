        a) Openning and Closing Tags: These tags have to be closed if opened. The openning tag turns
        the tag on and the closing tag switches the tag off.
        <opening_tag>, </closing_tag>
        b) Openning Tags: These are onsided tags that do not need any closing tags. 

Attributes: Attributes are values placed between the openning tags of the elements.
    Attributes help to modify the elements.

    <h1 id="theTopHeading">ID attribute stores the identifier to uniquely identify the particular h1 tag</h1>
    There are certain attributes such as style is used to embed inline CSS, allowing you to 
    modify the look and feel of an HTML element.
    Inline CSS: Inline CSS is a way of applying CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) directly to an 
                HTML element using the style attribute within the element's opening tag.
