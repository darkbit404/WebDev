        <!--Here href includes the link that leads to links tutorial by W3 Schools.
        And the text between the opening and closing is the text that is displayed on the webpage
        instead of the actual links.
            
        In HTML5 an empty <a> can act as avalid placeholder links for use with CSS.
                
        href attribute can aslo take address to a local file or a scipt.
        If we have a website with multiple webpages we can link the webpages to each other using 
        their respective relative path addresses.-->

            id is an attribute that is used with any of the tags to provide a unique identifier to the tag.
            The unique id can be used to access the specific tag later.
            
            ids assigned to headings of specific section can be used to link the section in another webpage.
            1) Add the link to the webpage which contains the section to be linked in different webpage in href attribute of a tag.
            2) Just after the link put a # which specifies that text further is an id.
            4) Add the id of the section to be linked.
            
            NOTE: No other punctuations, space or anything to be included btwn the link, # and the id of the section.-->
